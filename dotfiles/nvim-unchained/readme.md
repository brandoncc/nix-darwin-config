# nvim-unchained

After a long detour, this is my return to a distro-free configuration. After updating LunarVim caused my config to stop working multiple times, I switched to AstroNvim. I really liked it, but they also have a habit of making major changes periodically (at least they use semver though, so these changes are easier to deal with). I'm tired of using a config that zigs and zags unexpectedly though, so I'm starting a fresh config. It is so fresh I started it by typing `touch init.lua`.
